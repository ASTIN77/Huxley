# Huxley

![Huxley](src/Huxley/huxley.png "Huxley")

![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jpsingleton/huxley?retina=true "Build Status")

## Extremely simple restful JSON proxy for the UK National Rail Live Departure Board [SOAP](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/xml/soap/simple) [API](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/46391.aspx) ([Darwin](https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/))

You will need to add your access token to the URL for this to work. You can register to obtain one [here](https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/Registration).
Append the `accessToken={Your GUID token}` parameter to the query string for every request.

## Demo
There is an example deployment set up [here](https://huxley.apphb.com/).
(**DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS!**)

Paste this into your web console <kbd>F12</kbd>:
```javascript
var r = new XMLHttpRequest();
r.open("GET", "https://huxley.apphb.com/all/stp/from/bxs/1?accessToken=DA1C7740-9DA0-11E4-80E6-A920340000B1", true);
r.onreadystatechange = function () {
    if (r.readyState != 4 || r.status != 200) return;
    var resp = JSON.parse(r.response);
    if (resp.trainServices && resp.trainServices.length > 0) {
        alert("The next train to arrive at " + resp.locationName + " from " + resp.filterLocationName + " will get in at " + resp.trainServices[0].sta);
    } else {
        alert("Sorry, no trains from " + resp.filterLocationName + " arriving soon");
    }
};
r.send();
```

If you want to use this proxy then you should deploy the code to your own [App Harbor](https://appharbor.com/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) account.
If you deploy to the App Harbor Europe AWS region then this will run very close to the NRE servers.

SDKs in 9 languages (including Java, PHP, Python and Ruby) for this endpoint (generated with [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)) are available [here](http://restunited.com/releases/430721415517308710/wrappers). If you use these make sure to change the endpoint for production.

There is an additional Python (v2) [example for a Raspberry Pi and Blinky Tape RGB LED strip](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape_Python/blob/master/Huxley_UK_Rail_Station_Delays.py).

### URL Format

The URL format is `{board}/{CRS|StationName}/{filterType}/{filterCRS|StationName}/{numRows}` or `{board}/{CRS|StationName}/{numRows}` where only board and CRS (or a station name) are required. The filter type can be either `to` or `from` (case is not important).

A station name can be used in place of CRS codes if the name matches only one station (or matches one exactly) but case is not important. See the [CRS section](#crs-station-codes) below for more information.

Examples:

* 10 (default value) Arrivals and Departures at Clapham Junction: `/all/clj`
* 15 Arrivals and Departures at Clapham Junction: `/all/clj/15`
* 10 (default value) Departures at Clapham Junction to Waterloo: `/departures/clj/to/wat`
* 15 Arrivals at Clapham Junction from Waterloo: `/arrivals/clj/from/wat/15`
* 10 (default value) Arrivals and Departures at Wandsworth Common to Clapham Junction: `/all/wandsworth common/to/clapham junction`
* 20 Departures at East Croydon to London Victoria: `/departures/east croydon/to/london victoria/20`

### Departures

[`/departures/{Three letter CRS station code}?accessToken={Your GUID token}`](https://huxley.apphb.com/departures/crs?accessToken=)

### Arrivals

[`/arrivals/{Three letter CRS station code}?accessToken={Your GUID token}`](https://huxley.apphb.com/arrivals/crs?accessToken=)

### Departures and Arrivals

[`/all/{Three letter CRS station code}?accessToken={Your GUID token}`](https://huxley.apphb.com/all/crs?accessToken=)

### Service

[`/service/{Service ID}?accessToken={Your GUID token}`](https://huxley.apphb.com/service/Z/zlpIG8jJacKayAnOXODw==?accessToken=)

The service ID can be found for each service inside the departures and arrivals response.

This endpoint also accepts the [GUID representation of the ID](https://huxley.apphb.com/service/8c105350-4235-44f3-b076-87fe829c577e?accessToken=) as `/`, `+` and case sensitivity can cause trouble if you're not careful.
[More information on the wiki](https://github.com/jpsingleton/Huxley/wiki/Train-Service-IDs).

### Delays

The **delays** action performs calculations server side to easily let you know if there are problems on a particular route.

[`/delays/{crs}/{filtertype}/{filtercrs}/{numrows}?accessToken={Your GUID token}`](https://huxley.apphb.com/delays/gtw/to/lon/50?accessToken=)

**Sample Response:**
```javascript
{
  "generatedAt": "2015-04-24T14:59:29.6198809+01:00",
  "locationName": "Gatwick Airport",
  "crs": "GTW",
  "filterLocationName": "London",
  "filtercrs": "LON",
  "delays": true,
  "totalTrainsDelayed": 8,
  "totalDelayMinutes": 4,
  "totalTrains": 20
}
```

This action will accept `lon` or `London` as a filter CRS to find trains going to or coming from any London terminal.

You can also pass in a comma separated list of 24 hour train times to filter on (e.g. `/btn/to/lon/50/0729,0744,0748`).

## CRS Station Codes

CRS (Computer Reservation System) station codes are available from the following endpoint:

[`/crs/{query}`](https://huxley.apphb.com/crs)

If `query` is omitted then all CRS codes are returned along with their respective station names. If `query` is provided then only station names matching it will be returned along with their CRS codes.

Example response for `/crs/oswald`:
```javascript
[
  {
    "stationName": "Church & Oswaldtwistle",
    "crsCode": "CTW"
  },
  {
    "stationName": "Lazonby & Kirkoswald",
    "crsCode": "LZB"
  }
]
```
