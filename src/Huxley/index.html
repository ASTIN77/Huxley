            Huxley is a CORS enabled JSON ReST proxy for the UK National Rail Enquires Live Departure Board SOAP API (Darwin).
        </p>
        <h2>Access Tokens</h2>
        <p>
            You will need to add your access token to the URL for this to work. You can register to obtain one <a href="https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/Registration">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Append the <code>accessToken={ your token }</code> parameter to the query string for every request.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is optional support for configuring the access token server side. So you don't need to worry about revealing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to configure a random token and send this instead. If the token matches what the proxy has then it is replaced with your official token. Otherwise it is passed straight through.
            Look in the <code>Web.config</code> file for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>N.B.</strong> You should set up these tokens in your deployment platform and not in your source code repository. You'll notice that the values are blank by default.
        </p>
        <h2>API Endpoints</h2>
        <h3>Departures</h3>
        <code><a href="/departures/crs?accessToken=">/departures/[Three letter CRS station code]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]</a></code>
        <p>CRS station codes are available <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/static/documents/content/station_codes.csv">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Arrivals</h3>
        <code><a href="/arrivals/crs?accessToken=">/arrivals/[Three letter CRS station code]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]</a></code>
        <p>CRS station codes are available <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/static/documents/content/station_codes.csv">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Departures and Arrivals</h3>
        <code><a href="/all/crs?accessToken=">/all/[Three letter CRS station code]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]</a></code>
        <p>CRS station codes are available <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/static/documents/content/station_codes.csv">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Service</h3>
        <code><a href="/service/Z/zlpIG8jJacKayAnOXODw==?accessToken=">/service/[Service ID]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]</a></code>
        <p>
            The service ID can be found for each service inside the departures and arrivals response.
        </p>
        <p>
            This endpoint also accepts the <a href="/service/8c105350-4235-44f3-b076-87fe829c577e?accessToken=">GUID representation of the ID</a> as /, + and case sensitivity can cause trouble if you're not careful.
