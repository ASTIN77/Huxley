{"name":"Huxley","tagline":"A simple JSON proxy for the UK National Rail Live Departure Board SOAP API","body":"# Huxley\r\n\r\n![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jpsingleton/huxley?retina=true \"Build Status\")\r\n\r\n## A very simple JSON proxy for the UK National Rail Live Departure Board [SOAP](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/xml/soap/simple) [API](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/46391.aspx) ([Darwin](https://lite.realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWS/))\r\n\r\nSOAP is a pain to use (you have to POST specially crafted XML) so this proxy allows you to GET nicely formatted JSON instead (REST). It also adds CORS headers so you can access it with JavaScript from a different domain.\r\n\r\nYou will need to add your access token to the URL for this to work. You can register to obtain one [here](https://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/Registration).\r\nAppend the accessToken={your token} parameter to the query string for every request.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\nThere is an example deployment set up [here](https://huxley.apphb.com/).\r\n\r\n**DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS!**\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this proxy then you should deploy the code to your own [App Harbor](https://appharbor.com/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) account.\r\nIf you deploy to the App Harbor Europe AWS region then this will run very close to the NRE servers.\r\n\r\nSDKs in 9 languages (including Java and Ruby) for this endpoint (generated with [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)) are available [here](http://restunited.com/releases/430721415517308710/wrappers). If you use these make sure to change the endpoint for production.\r\n\r\n### Departures\r\n\r\n[/departures/[Three letter CRS station code]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]](https://huxley.apphb.com/departures/crs?accessToken=)\r\n\r\n### Arrivals\r\n\r\n[/arrivals/[Three letter CRS station code]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]](https://huxley.apphb.com/arrivals/crs?accessToken=)\r\n\r\n### Departures and Arrivals\r\n\r\n[/all/[Three letter CRS station code]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]](https://huxley.apphb.com/all/crs?accessToken=)\r\n\r\n### Service\r\n\r\n[/service/[Service ID]?accessToken=[Your GUID token]](https://huxley.apphb.com/service/Z/zlpIG8jJacKayAnOXODw==?accessToken=)\r\n\r\nThe service ID can be found for each service inside the departures and arrivals response.\r\n\r\nThis endpoint also accepts the [GUID representation of the ID](https://huxley.apphb.com/service/8c105350-4235-44f3-b076-87fe829c577e?accessToken=) as /, + and case sensitivity can cause trouble if you're not careful.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMade by [James Singleton](https://unop.uk)\r\n\r\n![powered by National Rail Enquiries](NRE_Powered_logo.png \"powered by National Rail Enquiries\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
